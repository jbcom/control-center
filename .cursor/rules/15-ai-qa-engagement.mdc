# AI Code Review (QA) Engagement

AI code reviews are **manual**, not automatic. Agents decide when to engage QA.

## When to Request Review

Request AI review for:
- Complex logic changes (algorithms, state machines)
- Security-sensitive code (auth, secrets, crypto)
- Breaking API changes
- Major refactors (>200 lines changed)
- Unfamiliar codebases (first time contributing)

Skip review for:
- Documentation-only changes
- Dependency bumps (Dependabot)
- Config/formatting changes
- Simple bug fixes with tests
- Changes you've thoroughly validated

## How to Request Review

Comment on the PR with one of:

```
@cursor review       # Cursor's AI review
/q review            # Amazon Q review
/gemini review       # Google Gemini review
@coderabbitai review # CodeRabbit AI review
```

Or be specific:
```
@cursor review security  # Focus on security
/q review performance    # Focus on performance
```

## Acting on Feedback

1. **Evaluate critically** - AI reviews can have false positives
2. **Prioritize blockers** - Fix critical/high severity issues
3. **Dismiss noise** - Style suggestions without justification
4. **Document reasoning** - If you disagree, explain why

## As the PR Owner

You own the PR - AI feedback is advisory, not authoritative.

- You decide what to fix
- You decide when to merge
- You can dismiss unhelpful feedback
- You're responsible for the final code

## Cross-Agent Collaboration

When another agent created the PR:
1. Don't overwrite their decisions without reason
2. Add your feedback as comments, not force-pushes
3. Tag them for significant changes: `@cursor what about...`
4. Respect their ownership

## QA Engagement is Judgment

Use your judgment. Not every PR needs review. When in doubt:
- Small, tested changes → Skip
- Complex, critical changes → Request
