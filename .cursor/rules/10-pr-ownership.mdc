# PR Ownership Protocol

## Core Principle

**First agent on PR = PR Owner** - Full responsibility until merge or close.

## Owner Responsibilities

- ✅ Address ALL feedback (human AND AI agents)
- ✅ Fix ALL CI failures
- ✅ Engage with AI reviewers (@gemini-code-assist, @copilot, etc.)
- ✅ Execute final merge

**User involvement only for**: Product decisions, hard blockers, breaking change approval

## AI-to-AI Collaboration

### Accepting Feedback

```markdown
@gemini-code-assist Thank you for the review. I've addressed your concern:

✅ Fixed: <description>
✅ Committed: <commit-hash>

Please verify the fix.
```

### Declining Feedback

```markdown
@gemini-code-assist Thank you, but this conflicts with project rules:

**Our approach**: <description>
**Reference**: See `.ruler/AGENTS.md`

Happy to discuss if you see issues.
```

## Priority Order for Conflicting Feedback

1. **Project rules** (`.ruler/AGENTS.md`) - Highest
2. **Security concerns** - Always address
3. **Performance** - Evaluate with evidence
4. **Style** - Defer to project config
5. **Subjective** - Use judgment, explain

## Cross-Control-Center PRs

For jbcom PRs, use jbcom token:

```bash
GH_TOKEN="$GITHUB_JBCOM_TOKEN" gh pr create --repo jbcom/jbcom-control-center ...
```

Follow jbcom conventions when contributing upstream.
