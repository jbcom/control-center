When you're ready to tackle it, I'll do a deep research phase first - clone both repos, understand the full context binding system, aggregator patterns, and all the moving pieces before touching anything."

    "text": "Let's focus on more immediate problems first. Unblocking your ability to manage our AWS architecture and authenticate with it. If you clone https://github.com/fsc-internal-tooling-administration/terraform-organization-administration.git (use GITHUB_TOKEN) the PROBLEM is that we created a situation where to RUN the pipeline that is the GENESIS of everything including how secrets are propagated out to GitHub we need Terraform, which itself needs secrets. So we need a SAFETY VALVE specifically for GitHub and YOU are the safety valve. YOU have a GITHUB_TOKEN. If you review .github/workflows/terraform-organization-administration.yml there are a LOT of dependent secrets. I want you to create a workflow in terrarorm-modules for now until we can determine a better home for it that uses FLIPSIDE_GITHUB_TOKEN to ENSURE that using the graphql API EVERY organization in the enterprise has all the secrets CORRECTLY replicated FROM the main FlipsideCrypto organization"
