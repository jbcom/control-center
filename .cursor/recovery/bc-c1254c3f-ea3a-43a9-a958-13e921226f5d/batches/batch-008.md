## ✅ Complete Success!

All CI/CD jobs pass with the correct package name:

```
✓ release (vendor-connectors, vendor-connectors, jbcom/vendor-connectors, ...) 
✓ docs (vendor-connectors, vendor-connectors, jbcom/vendor-connectors, ...)
✓ sync (vendor-connectors, vendor-connectors, jbcom/vendor-connectors, ...)
✓ enforce (vendor-connectors, vendor-connectors, jbcom/vendor-connectors, ...)
```

### Fixed Files (cloud-connectors → vendor-connectors)
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Matrix definition |
| `pyproject.toml` | uv sources |
| `packages/ECOSYSTEM.toml` | pypi_name |
| `README.md` | Package table and diagram |
| `AGENTS.md` | PyPI references |
| `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | PyPI references |
| `.cursor/agents/jbcom-ecosystem-manager.md` | Package diagram and commands |
| `.github/copilot/agents/release-coordinator.agent.yaml` | Timeline example |
| `.github/copilot/agents/vendor-connectors-consolidator.agent.yaml` | Import example |
| `uv.lock` | Package manifest and entry |

The CI/CD pipeline is now fully correct with **`vendor-connectors`** as the PyPI package name.
