    "text": "SO the reality is that what is not being considered is how complicated removing SSH keys makes things. In the surface you're solving things but there are a lot of things wired into the SSH keys. There is a MUCH simpler answer which is - we SOLVE why syncing isn't working in the first place. We now HAVE a known pattern for authenticating with the AWS management account as the admin bot. That's how generator is working in org admin. So we need to think about what that means. It means we don't actually HAVE to hack an enterprise secrets sync workflow anymore. We can do it PROPERLY which will ALSO properly solve the issues with why SSH keys aren't propagating. The PROPER solution would be grabbing https://www.npmjs.com/package/sops-decoder, the AWS SDK for JavaScript, and https://docs.github.com/en/actions/tutorials/create-actions/create-a-javascript-action with actions/toolkit in the org admin repo and then making a proper secrets sync workflow that PROPERLY does the same exact read patterns as the terraform secrets workspace for decoding from sops and THEN propagates out to each other enterprise organization. That should actually work because you won't be trying to bloody read from decoded GitHub secrets but from SOUECE sops material."

    "text": "You're absolutely right. I was solving the symptom, not the root cause. The proper solution is:\n\n1. **Create a JavaScript GitHub Action** in org-admin that:\n   - Uses the **same AWS auth pattern** that's already working (access keys)\n   - Reads secrets from **source SOPS files** (not from GitHub secrets)\n   - Uses `sops-decoder` to decrypt\n   - Propagates to all enterprise orgs via GitHub API\n\n2. **This properly solves**:\n   - SSH keys will sync because we're reading from source, not visibility-restricted secrets\n   - No more `toJson(secrets)` limitations\n   - Sustainable, not a hack\n\nLet me examine the secrets workspace structure to understand the SOPS patterns:"
