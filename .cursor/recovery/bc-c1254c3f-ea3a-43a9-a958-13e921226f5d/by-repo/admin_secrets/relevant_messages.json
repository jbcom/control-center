Options:\n\n1. **Add the PAT owner as org admin** on `fsc-internal-tooling-administration`\n2. **Use a fine-grained PAT** that has secrets:write on both orgs\n3. **Create the token in fsc-internal-tooling-administration** instead (reverse the sync direction)\n\nWhich approach do you want to take? Once the token has write access, the safety valve will work and we can bootstrap the rest."
