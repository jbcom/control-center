    "text": "Honestly? No, there are gaps. Let me critically assess:\n\n## What Works ✅\n- **Git-committed memory**: `.cursor/memory-bank/` is in git, survives across sessions\n- **GitHub Issues/Projects**: Persist regardless of branch/session\n- **Documented rules**: `agenticRules.md` provides consistent behavior guidance\n\n## What's Problematic ⚠️\n\n### 1. Branch-Specific Memory\nThe memory-bank is on branch `fix/vendor-connectors-pypi-name`. When working on `main` or other branches, it won't be visible until merged.\n\n```bash\n# On main branch - no memory-bank yet!\ngit checkout main\nls .cursor/memory-bank/  # Doesn't exist\n```\n\n### 2. External Repos Are Ephemeral\n```bash\n# This is gitignored - disappears on re-clone\n/workspace/external/terraform-modules/memory-bank/\n```\n\n### 3. No Automatic Reading\nAgents don't automatically read memory-bank. Relies on instructions being followed.\n\n## Fixes Needed"
