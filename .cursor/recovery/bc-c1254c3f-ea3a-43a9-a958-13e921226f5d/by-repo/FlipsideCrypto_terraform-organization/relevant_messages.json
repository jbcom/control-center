There are TWO repos that actually generate other repos, https://github.com/fsc-internal-tooling-administration/terraform-organization-administration.git and https://github.com/FlipsideCrypto/terraform-organization.git. LITERALLY THE ONLY THING that terraform-organization does is crap that Org admin could do if we took config/pipeline_categories/repositories.yaml from org and swapped it into config/pipelines.yaml in org admin. Swap out the context binding references for terraform org aggregator to org admin secrets. This is NOT something I want you to deal with NOW and I don't think you HAVE enough information to fully understand or Act on that stuff yet - I never want you to REACT, I want you to always RESEARCH ahead of any new task and FULLY empower yourself with ALL necessary information. But I do want you to record it in my memory as something to work on after you're freed up"
