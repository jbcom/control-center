Honestly? No. For a repo like terraform-modules with low merge concurrency, they're just adding friction:

- Extra wait time on every merge
- Have to poll for status
- No real benefit when PRs aren't racing to main

Merge queues shine when you have 10+ PRs trying to merge simultaneously and need to ensure each is tested against the latest main. For internal tooling repos with 1-2 contributors (or one agent), they're overhead.

Want me to check the workflow result, or would you rather disable the merge queue on terraform-modules first?
