The proper solution is:\n\n1. **Create a JavaScript GitHub Action** in org-admin that:\n   - Uses the **same AWS auth pattern** that's already working (access keys)\n   - Reads secrets from **source SOPS files** (not from GitHub secrets)\n   - Uses `sops-decoder` to decrypt\n   - Propagates to all enterprise orgs via GitHub API\n\n2. **This properly solves**:\n   - SSH keys will sync because we're reading from source, not visibility-restricted secrets\n   - No more `toJson(secrets)` limitations\n   - Sustainable, not a hack\n\nLet me examine the secrets workspace structure to understand the SOPS patterns:"
