Addressed PR feedback on both PRs:\n\n## terraform-modules PR #206 (Safety Valve)\n- ✅ Removed `enterprise_secrets.py` (security concerns)\n- ✅ Pinned `pynacl==1.5.0` version\n- ✅ Added job `timeout-minutes: 15`\n- ✅ Pre-install pynacl instead of fallback\n\n## terraform-aws-secretsmanager PR #43 (Merger Lambda)\n- ✅ Pinned exact versions in `requirements.txt`\n- ✅ Added JSON parsing error handling\n- ✅ Added circular inheritance detection\n- ✅ Added ARN format validation\n- ✅ Removed unused local variables\n\nBoth PRs should now pass security review. The remaining IAM overpermissions note in the merger lambda is harder to address without knowing the exact account IDs at terraform time - that's more of a deployment-time consideration."
