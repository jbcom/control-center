Now I'm satisfied. Here's the complete memory persistence setup:

## ✅ Memory Bank Now Properly Persists

### On Main Branch
```
.cursor/memory-bank/
├── README.md          # How to use memory system
├── activeContext.md   # Current work focus
├── progress.md        # Task tracking & history
└── agenticRules.md    # Behavior rules reference
```

### Key Improvements Made

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Branch-specific** | Memory-bank now on `main`, available everywhere |
| **External repos ephemeral** | Documented in rules - keep synchronized |
| **No auto-reading** | Added to agent instructions as CRITICAL first step |
| **No GitHub tracking** | Created project + issues for persistent tracking |

### How It Works Now

**Session Start** (any agent, any branch):
```bash
cat .cursor/memory-bank/activeContext.md  # What's happening now
cat .cursor/memory-bank/progress.md        # What was done before
```

**During Work**:
- Update progress.md after completions
- Create/update GitHub issues for tracking

**Session End**:
- Update activeContext.md with next steps
- Commit memory-bank changes with your work

### Tracking Infrastructure

| Resource | URL |
|----------|-----|
| **GitHub Project** | [jbcom Ecosystem Integration](https://github.com/users/jbcom/projects/2) |
| **Issue #200** | terraform-modules: vendor-connectors integration |
| **Issue #201** | deepmerge → extended-data-types |
| **Issue #202** | Secrets terraform wrapper removal |
| **PR #166** | ✅ Merged - memory-bank infrastructure |
| **PR #203** | terraform-modules integration |

### Cross-Session Verification
```bash
# On any branch, memory-bank is available:
git checkout main && ls .cursor/memory-bank/  # ✅ Works
git checkout some-feature && ls .cursor/memory-bank/  # ✅ Works (inherited from main)
```
