What I want you to do is get the secrets synced across the enterprise and then trigger and observe a run of the workflow I showed you in org admin that goes generator > secrets and observe it, make sure with the secrets synced terraform is now unblocked for our org admin org. That will ALSO create the cursor background agent IAM role. I then want you to add https://github.com/jbcom/otterfall.git to your managed repositories - it's one of my games. It ALSO has a .cursor directory with a Dockerfile and an environment.json. do NOT mess with the paths within it even if it DOES feel counterintuitive how it specified "." Versus "..". The POINT is that is a SOLID blood python and nodejs dockerfile that would be MYCH better to start things off and you could CUDTOMIZE IT for our control center needs. Add terraform aligned to defaults.yaml in org admin, terragrunt, process compose, AWS CLI, rust 1.91, golang 1.23, REALLY set the NEXT version of you up for MYCH stronger success. And no copying files IN it's a background agent dickerfile the agent does all copying 

And then the LAST thing is a PROPER handoff procedure DOCUENNTED and recorded in your agentic processes. Something that factors in your github project tracking, GitHub issues, any PRs in this and OTHER repos you have in progreßs, and then FINALLy closing our the HOLDING PR
