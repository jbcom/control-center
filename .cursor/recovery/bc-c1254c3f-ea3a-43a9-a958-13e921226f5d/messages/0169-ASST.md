## ✅ Completed This Session

| Task | Status |
|------|--------|
| jbcom-control-center PR #168 | **MERGED** - vendor-connectors secrets management |
| terraform-modules PR #205 | **MERGED** - Removed deprecated secrets methods |
| terraform-aws-secretsmanager PR #43 | **Created** - Merger lambda using ecosystem packages |

## 📝 Recorded for Future (Research First)

**FlipsideCrypto Org Repo Consolidation:**
- Merge `FlipsideCrypto/terraform-organization` → `fsc-internal-tooling-administration/terraform-organization-administration`
- Move `config/pipeline_categories/repositories.yaml` → `config/pipelines.yaml`  
- Update context bindings: `terraform-org-aggregator` → `org-admin-secrets`
- **Status**: Recorded in memory-bank, will research thoroughly before acting

The future task is locked in. When you're ready to tackle it, I'll do a deep research phase first - clone both repos, understand the full context binding system, aggregator patterns, and all the moving pieces before touching anything.
