Honestly? No, there are gaps. Let me critically assess:

## What Works ✅
- **Git-committed memory**: `.cursor/memory-bank/` is in git, survives across sessions
- **GitHub Issues/Projects**: Persist regardless of branch/session
- **Documented rules**: `agenticRules.md` provides consistent behavior guidance

## What's Problematic ⚠️

### 1. Branch-Specific Memory
The memory-bank is on branch `fix/vendor-connectors-pypi-name`. When working on `main` or other branches, it won't be visible until merged.

```bash
# On main branch - no memory-bank yet!
git checkout main
ls .cursor/memory-bank/  # Doesn't exist
```

### 2. External Repos Are Ephemeral
```bash
# This is gitignored - disappears on re-clone
/workspace/external/terraform-modules/memory-bank/
```

### 3. No Automatic Reading
Agents don't automatically read memory-bank. Relies on instructions being followed.

## Fixes Needed
