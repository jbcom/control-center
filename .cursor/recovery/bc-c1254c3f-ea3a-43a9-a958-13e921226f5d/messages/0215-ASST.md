The issue is clear now:

**`FLIPSIDE_GITHUB_TOKEN` doesn't have org admin/secrets write permission on `fsc-internal-tooling-administration`**

This is a one-time bootstrap problem. Options:

1. **Add the PAT owner as org admin** on `fsc-internal-tooling-administration`
2. **Use a fine-grained PAT** that has secrets:write on both orgs
3. **Create the token in fsc-internal-tooling-administration** instead (reverse the sync direction)

Which approach do you want to take? Once the token has write access, the safety valve will work and we can bootstrap the rest.
