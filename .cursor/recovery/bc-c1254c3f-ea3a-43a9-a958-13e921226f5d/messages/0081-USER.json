Use your GITHUB_TOKEN (Because it's a FlipsideCrypto repo) to get the latest for https://github.com/FlipsideCrypto/terraform-modules.git and FIRST FINISH Extract cloud service connectors into cloud-connectors package #185 by PROPERLY updating the PR to clarify it to ALSO be vendor connectors and then to PROPERLY finish REMOVING the pieces that are now represented fully by our released vendor-connectors python package. Then make sure ALL the wiring is setup so that terraform_data_sources.oy uses OUR public caching API instead, etc .... Passes through logging, inputs... Use this ALSO as an opportunity it identify ANYTHING we missed that is necessary to solve INTEGRATION of our package with a broader codebase and issue a patch release of anything to vendor-connectors if necessary and get THAT through, so that ultimately the goal is to MERGE 185 to main on terraform-modules.  THEN similarly look at PR Revert library, integrate OSS clients, and refactor cloud connectors #183 and use THAT or as an opportunity to remove as much of utils.py as possible, logging, etc .. and replace with all our ecosystem packages from extended data types through lifecycle logging through directed inputs class and so on, cleaning up pyproject.toml of DIRECT includes in the process. Get that merged. THEN I want you to finally review the SAM LAMBDAS for merging and syncing secrets in terraform-modules that USE and exercise all of this functionality as they are the strongest validation of all of this work in a NON terraform setting. I want you to REMOVE that godawful sam nonsense because AI cannot properly automate AWS SAM and it's been A MESS and INSTEAD clone https://github.com/FlipsideCrypto/terraform-aws-secretsmanager.git (Alslo With the GITHUB_TOKEN) which will allow you to PROPERLY see the original mixed Terrafoem / lambda merge / sync secrets pipeline for taking secrets from Vault and AWS sources and shipping them to AWS accounts and PROPERLY create a new PR against the repo to extend the secrets workspace such that similar to how right now the lambda workspace deploys instances of the workspaces/lambda/src/app.py syncing lambda to the management account but if you look at the secrets workspace it is calling modules workspaces/secrets/import_sources.tf like:\n\nmodule \"aws_import_source\" {\n  for_each = local.aws_import_sources\n\n  source = \"git@github.com:FlipsideCrypto/terraform-modules.git//aws/aws-list-aws-account-secrets\"\n\n  get_secrets      = true\n  no_empty_secrets = true\n\n  execution_role_arn = each.value\n\n  log_file_name = \"${each.key}-aws-import-source.log\"\n}\n\nWell THOSE are actually when you run tm_cli terraform_modules in terrarorm-modules those are terraform wrappers around python methods in terraform_data_sources py. So FIRST OFF ONLY secrets syncing USES those methods and SECOND we Wouldn't NEED them to be terraform if they were only called by lambdas so I want you to review everything in this workspace like list aws secrets list vault secrets go through terraform data source and then move all THOSE out of terraform-modulea creating TWO corresponding PRs one for EEMOVAL of the Vault secrets methods and all the Aws secrets and the second in HERE for ENRICHMENT of the VAULT CLIENT in vendor connectors and AWS CLIENT so that it can DIRECTLY handle that stuff as core functionality. \n\nALSO make sure that DEEPMERGE in terraform_dAta_dource is in extended data types in map utils and then is CALLED by its terraform equivalent in terraform data source since in that case we DO need both (e.g. a proxy method in terrarorm_data_source that CALLS the actual method in extended-data-tyoes)\n\n\n\nGet all that done and then if you go BACK to terraform-aws-secretsmanager you can in a PR refsctir the lambda in the lambda workspace (which is poorly named, it really should be the syncing workspace, but leave that alone) to use core ecosystem packages. And then remove that standalone processor script from the secrets workspace (which again, poorly named, should be merging, leave that also alone for now). And add a lambda THERE for MERGING basically ANITHER app.py same lines as the one in the lambda workspace same deployment mechanism with terrafirm but replacing the logic with the fireach and the calls to list aws secrets and list vault secrets and copy to s3 and deep merge.... See what I mean??? ALL of that can be a lambda using core ecosystem packages which is why I said make deepmeege a part of extended data types. And then we can ACTUALLY finally unblock!!!"
