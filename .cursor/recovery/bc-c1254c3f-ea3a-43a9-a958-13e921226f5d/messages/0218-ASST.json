  "text": "Ah - so my `GITHUB_TOKEN` IS `FLIPSIDE_GITHUB_TOKEN`. That means the token genuinely lacks permissions on `fsc-internal-tooling-administration`.\n\nThis needs to be fixed in GitHub org settings:\n\n1. Go to `fsc-internal-tooling-administration` → Settings → Member privileges\n2. Or add the token's owner as an org owner/admin\n\nCan you grant that access, or should I check who owns this token to see what permissions they have?"
