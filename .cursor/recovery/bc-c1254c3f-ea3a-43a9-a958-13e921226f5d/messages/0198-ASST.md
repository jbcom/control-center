Done. I've established a comprehensive memory-bank structure:

## Memory Bank Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `systemPatterns.md` | Authentication, repo map, workflow patterns, safety valve usage |
| `techContext.md` | AWS accounts, Vault config, package details, CLI commands |
| `productContext.md` | Why systems exist, quality standards, anti-patterns |
| `activeContext.md` | Current session status, pending items, decisions |
| `progress.md` | Task tracking, ecosystem health |

## Key Things I Now Understand

**Authentication:**
- `GITHUB_JBCOM_TOKEN` for jbcom repos
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` for FlipsideCrypto repos  
- `FLIPSIDE_GITHUB_TOKEN` for enterprise-wide operations

**Ecosystem Relationships:**
- jbcom packages form a dependency chain with extended-data-types at the foundation
- terraform-organization-administration is the genesis repo
- Safety valve breaks the bootstrap chicken-egg problem

**Operational Patterns:**
- CalVer auto-versioning, no manual version management
- Research before react on new tasks
- Address PR feedback before merging

**My Role:**
- Full automation agent for both ecosystems
- Can trigger safety valve when needed
- Can manage PRs, releases, infrastructure changes

What would you like me to focus on next?
