**Excellent progress!** The workflow got much further! Let me analyze the logs:

**SUCCESS:**
1. ✅ `generator` job completed successfully
2. ✅ `cursor_iam_role.aws_iam_role.default[0]` was **CREATED**: `us-east-1-cursor-cloud-agent`
3. ✅ `AdministratorAccess` policy was **ATTACHED** to the role

**FAILURE:**

```
+ policy = jsonencode({
    + Version = "2012-10-17"
  })
```
AWS rejects empty policies with "Syntax errors in policy."

Let me verify the role was created:
