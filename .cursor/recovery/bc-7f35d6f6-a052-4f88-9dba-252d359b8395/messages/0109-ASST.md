You're right - I opened them to preserve the work on branches for handoff. The issue is the **inconsistency between PRs**, not that the code is lost.

The problem:

| PR | Content | Conflict |
|---|---|---|
| **#245** | vendor-connectors migration (100% parity) | **Pre-existing** - complete migration |
| **#249** | vendor-connectors migration (partial) | **Overlaps with #245** - same functions |

PR #245 and #249 both add the same vendor-connectors functions to the same files. They're competing PRs.

**The consistent picture should be:**

```
#245 (vendor-connectors - AUTHORITATIVE, pre-existing)
#246 (docs) - BUT references #247/#248 which may not be wanted
#247 (directed-inputs decorators) - NEW WORK
#248 (python-terraform-bridge) - NEW WORK  
#249 (vendor-connectors) - REDUNDANT with #245
```

**Questions to resolve:**

1. Is #245 the authoritative vendor-connectors PR, making #249 redundant?
2. Are #247 (decorators) and #248 (terraform-bridge) still wanted, or was that work intentionally reverted?
3. Should #246 (docs) be updated to only reference the work that's actually proceeding?

What's the intended scope of work going forward?
