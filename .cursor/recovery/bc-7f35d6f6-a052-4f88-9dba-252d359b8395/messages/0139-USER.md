And of course YOU are not going to yourself  check.... So it's quite the interesting little puZle. It's like you basically need to use process-compose with something that can use your hold open PR so that YOU get @cursor notices using the GITHUB_JBCOM_TOKEN (effectively the same as ME reminding you) - basically you would run a system that would go out and in in both directions. Fan out and periodically do "check in, report progress, state blockers, etc...." for all sub agents, and then when a sub agent is DONE or changes the status of a PR or gives a status update pings YOU through a Pr Update on the hold open PR
