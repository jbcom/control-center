Based on my review, **the PRs are NOT consistent** with the current workspace. Here's the analysis:

## Current PR State

| PR | Title | Status | Issue |
|---|---|---|---|
| **#245** | vendor-connectors migration (100% parity) | ✅ Valid | Complete implementation |
| **#246** | docs/wiki-orchestration-update | ⚠️ Outdated | References deleted work |
| **#247** | directed-inputs-decorator-api | ❌ Invalid | Code deleted from workspace |
| **#248** | python-terraform-bridge | ❌ Invalid | Entire package deleted |
| **#249** | vendor-connectors-migration | ❌ Redundant | Overlaps with #245 |

## Issues

1. **PRs #247, #248**: The code has been completely deleted from the workspace
   - `decorators.py` - gone
   - `test_decorators.py` - gone  
   - `python-terraform-bridge/` - source files gone

2. **PR #249** overlaps with **PR #245** - they both add vendor-connectors migration functions, but #245 is more comprehensive

3. **PR #246** documents work (#247, #248) that no longer exists

## Recommendation

Should I:
1. **Close PRs #247, #248, #249** - they contain deleted/redundant work
2. **Update or close PR #246** - docs reference deleted work
3. **Keep PR #245** - appears to be the authoritative vendor-connectors migration
