Got it - `packages/` is used for **both** Python and Node.js. The uv workspace in root `pyproject.toml` explicitly lists only the Python packages:

```toml
[tool.uv.workspace]
members = [
    "packages/extended-data-types",
    "packages/lifecyclelogging",
    "packages/directed-inputs-class",
    "packages/vendor-connectors",
]
```

So `cursor-fleet` is TypeScript (has `package.json`), the rest are Python (have `pyproject.toml`).

To add `python-terraform-bridge`:

1. Create `packages/python-terraform-bridge/` with `pyproject.toml`
2. Add to root `pyproject.toml`:
   ```toml
   [tool.uv.workspace]
   members = [
       "packages/extended-data-types",
       "packages/lifecyclelogging",
       "packages/directed-inputs-class",
       "packages/vendor-connectors",
       "packages/python-terraform-bridge",  # NEW
   ]
   
   [tool.uv.sources]
   python-terraform-bridge = { workspace = true }  # NEW
   ```

Want me to scaffold it out?
