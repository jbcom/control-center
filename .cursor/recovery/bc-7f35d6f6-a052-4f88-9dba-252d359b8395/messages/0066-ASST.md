Now properly documented and linked. Here's the actual state:

## What Was Already Done (by prior agents)
- **PRs #229, #236-#241**: Core migration (AWS, Google, GitHub, Slack, Vault) - ~5,000 lines
- **PR #244**: Google constants module
- **Issue terraform-modules#220**: Gap analysis documenting what was missing

## What PR #245 Adds (addressing #220 gaps)
- **+915 lines** implementing the specific functions identified as missing
- AWS: `label_account`, `classify_accounts`, `preprocess_organization`, `get_bucket_sizes`
- Google: `get_project_iam_users`, `get_pubsub_resources_for_project`, `find_inactive_projects`, `list_available_licenses`, `get_bigquery_billing_dataset`
- GitHub: `get_users_with_verified_emails`, `build_workflow*`

## What I Should Have Done From Start
1. Read wiki/FSC docs → Understood FSC counterparty relationship
2. Read ORCHESTRATION.md → Known what was already done
3. Read terraform-modules#220 → Known exact gaps to fill
4. Then execute systematically

Instead I fumbled around rediscovering context that was already documented. The work output is correct, but the process was inefficient.

**Next step**: Merge PR #245, then update terraform-modules to consume the new vendor-connectors APIs (phase 2 of #220).
