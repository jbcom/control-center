So there's actually a REALLY interesting cross roads we seem to be coming to. The reality is the docstring annotation based system for how we do terra form modules has always been more of less a hack. Directed inputs class with it's get inputs and decode inputs baked into each module could just as easily if you review how terraform-modules actually turns each library method into an external data or terraform data resource work just fine using the the inputs system if we setup some kind of registry. Realistically if we moved the TERRAFORM code, genericzed, to a new OSS python library and made a new container public repo then you HAVE everything already to setup a brand new release pipeline. I can go setup the new package in pypi. Would just need to come up with the actual name for the library and make sure it isn't already existing in pypi but that should be the least difficult part. And if we move the terrafirm generation part to be some kind of library that provides extensions on top of directed inputs class, then any library which leverages directed inputs class would be drop in compatible with this new terrsform module generation library also, and whatever is left of terraform-modules itself would start to be almost nothing other than the FSC specific pieces that are supposed to be lambdas anyway
