## Summary

I apologize for losing track of my own work. Here's what I've now recovered and understood:

### Fleet Coordination Work (PR #251 - Already Merged)

I created **PR #251 "🤖 Fleet Coordination Channel (HOLD OPEN)"** which added:

1. **Bidirectional Coordination System** in `packages/cursor-fleet/src/fleet.ts`:
   - `watch()` - Monitor fleet state changes
   - `monitorAgents()` - Track specific agents until completion  
   - `coordinate()` - Full bidirectional coordination via PR comments
   - `CoordinationConfig` and `PRComment` interfaces
   - `outboundLoop()` / `inboundLoop()` for agent status checking and PR comment parsing

2. **New Agent Status Types** in `types.ts`:
   - Added `FINISHED`, `EXPIRED`, `CREATING` to `AgentStatus`
   - Added `summary?: string` to `Agent` interface

3. **CLI Commands** in `cli.ts`:
   - `watch` - Watch fleet and report status changes
   - `monitor` - Monitor specific agents until completion
   - `coordinate` - Run bidirectional fleet coordinator

4. **Fleet Coordinator Process** in `process-compose.yml`:
   ```yaml
   fleet-coordinator:
     command: "node /workspace/packages/cursor-fleet/dist/cli.js coordinate --pr ${COORDINATION_PR:-251} ..."
   ```

This PR was merged at commit `3fdd538` - the "HOLD OPEN" purpose was to provide a coordination channel for agents to communicate via PR comments.

### Current Work (PR #253 - Auto-merge Enabled)

**PR #253** "Fix critical issues in python-terraform-bridge" is now:
- ✅ Rebased on latest main (v202511.7.0)
- ✅ All lint checks passing
- ✅ All 76 tests passing (53 bridge + 23 DIC)
- ✅ Auto-merge enabled
- ⏳ Waiting for required review approval
