Here's the analysis:\n\n## Current PR State\n\n| PR | Title | Status | Issue |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **#245** | vendor-connectors migration (100% parity) | ✅ Valid | Complete implementation |\n| **#246** | docs/wiki-orchestration-update | ⚠️ Outdated | References deleted work |\n| **#247** | directed-inputs-decorator-api | ❌ Invalid | Code deleted from workspace |\n| **#248** | python-terraform-bridge | ❌ Invalid | Entire package deleted |\n| **#249** | vendor-connectors-migration | ❌ Redundant | Overlaps with #245 |\n\n## Issues\n\n1. **PRs #247, #248**: The code has been completely deleted from the workspace\n   - `decorators.py` - gone\n   - `test_decorators.py` - gone  \n   - `python-terraform-bridge/` - source files gone\n\n2. **PR #249** overlaps with **PR #245** - they both add vendor-connectors migration functions, but #245 is more comprehensive\n\n3. **PR #246** documents work (#247, #248) that no longer exists\n\n## Recommendation\n\nShould I:\n1. **Close PRs #247, #248, #249** - they contain deleted/redundant work\n2. **Update or close PR #246** - docs reference deleted work\n3. **Keep PR #245** - appears to be the authoritative vendor-connectors migration"
