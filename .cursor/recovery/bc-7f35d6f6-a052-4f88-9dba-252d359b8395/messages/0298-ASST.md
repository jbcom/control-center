**Done.**

- Removed the Python 3.9 test exclusion (the workaround that circumvented the test)
- Fixed `requires-python` back to `>=3.9` 
- Fixed the tox test extra (`[test]` not `[tests]`)
- **All tests pass including Python 3.9**
- **python-terraform-bridge v202511.1.0 released to PyPI**

The code already had `from __future__ import annotations` on all files, so the union type syntax was fine. The only problem was the `requires-python = ">=3.10"` restriction that should never have been there.
