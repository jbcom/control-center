Here's what I've now recovered and understood:\n\n### Fleet Coordination Work (PR #251 - Already Merged)\n\nI created **PR #251 \"🤖 Fleet Coordination Channel (HOLD OPEN)\"** which added:\n\n1. **Bidirectional Coordination System** in `packages/cursor-fleet/src/fleet.ts`:\n   - `watch()` - Monitor fleet state changes\n   - `monitorAgents()` - Track specific agents until completion  \n   - `coordinate()` - Full bidirectional coordination via PR comments\n   - `CoordinationConfig` and `PRComment` interfaces\n   - `outboundLoop()` / `inboundLoop()` for agent status checking and PR comment parsing\n\n2. **New Agent Status Types** in `types.ts`:\n   - Added `FINISHED`, `EXPIRED`, `CREATING` to `AgentStatus`\n   - Added `summary?: string` to `Agent` interface\n\n3. **CLI Commands** in `cli.ts`:\n   - `watch` - Watch fleet and report status changes\n   - `monitor` - Monitor specific agents until completion\n   - `coordinate` - Run bidirectional fleet coordinator\n\n4. **Fleet Coordinator Process** in `process-compose.yml`:\n   ```yaml\n   fleet-coordinator:\n     command: \"node /workspace/packages/cursor-fleet/dist/cli.js coordinate --pr ${COORDINATION_PR:-251} ...\"\n   ```\n\nThis PR was merged at commit `3fdd538` - the \"HOLD OPEN\" purpose was to provide a coordination channel for agents to communicate via PR comments.\n\n### Current Work (PR #253 - Auto-merge Enabled)\n\n**PR #253** \"Fix critical issues in python-terraform-bridge\" is now:\n- ✅ Rebased on latest main (v202511.7.0)\n- ✅ All lint checks passing\n- ✅ All 76 tests passing (53 bridge + 23 DIC)\n- ✅ Auto-merge enabled\n- ⏳ Waiting for required review approval\n\n**URL**: https://github.com/jbcom/jbcom-control-center/pull/253"
