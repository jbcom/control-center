Read wiki/FSC docs → Understood FSC counterparty relationship\n2. Read ORCHESTRATION.md → Known what was already done\n3. Read terraform-modules#220 → Known exact gaps to fill\n4. Then execute systematically\n\nInstead I fumbled around rediscovering context that was already documented. The work output is correct, but the process was inefficient.\n\n**Next step**: Merge PR #245, then update terraform-modules to consume the new vendor-connectors APIs (phase 2 of #220)."
