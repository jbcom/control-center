They're competing PRs.\n\n**The consistent picture should be:**\n\n```\n#245 (vendor-connectors - AUTHORITATIVE, pre-existing)\n#246 (docs) - BUT references #247/#248 which may not be wanted\n#247 (directed-inputs decorators) - NEW WORK\n#248 (python-terraform-bridge) - NEW WORK  \n#249 (vendor-connectors) - REDUNDANT with #245\n```\n\n**Questions to resolve:**\n\n1. Is #245 the authoritative vendor-connectors PR, making #249 redundant?\n2. Are #247 (decorators) and #248 (terraform-bridge) still wanted, or was that work intentionally reverted?\n3. Should #246 (docs) be updated to only reference the work that's actually proceeding?\n\nWhat's the intended scope of work going forward?"
