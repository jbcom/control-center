THEN You need to engage your fleet management tooling PROPERLY - that's the point OF the split PRs. Review your tooling in packages and update it to NOT force GPT Codex 5.1 - if we DON'T specify a model it allows the cloud agent API to automatically select the best one. And then ONE agent can focus on one Pr and ONE agent on the next PR and YOU use your fleet management tooling to COMMUNICATE with them and COORDINATE"
