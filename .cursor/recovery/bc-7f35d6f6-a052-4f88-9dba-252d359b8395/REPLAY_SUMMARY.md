## Session Summary

*   `directed-inputs-class` was refactored to a decorator-based API (`@directed_inputs`) for cleaner input handling, eliminating forced inheritance and WET patterns.
*   `python-terraform-bridge` was created to abstract Terraform module generation.
*   Agent documentation was overhauled, moving rules to `.ruler/` and session tracking to GitHub Issues, deprecating the wiki.
*   `cursor-fleet` gained bidirectional coordination via PR comments.
*   `python-terraform-bridge` was made Python 3.9 compatible, and its PyPI release was fixed in CI.
