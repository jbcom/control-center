* Add automated agent triage pipeline ([#186](https://github.com/jbcom/control-center/issues/186)) * feat: Add automated agent triage pipeline Adds local agent triage tooling that works without MCP dependency: ## New Scripts ### agent-triage-local - Analyzes conversation.json files directly - Extracts repositories, PRs, branches, files mentioned - Decomposes into repository-specific tasks - Can execute forensic analysis with aider Modes: - analyze: Extract artifacts from conversation - decompose: Create per-repository task files - execute: Run aider for AI-powered analysis - full: Run all phases ### triage-pipeline - Scans for unprocessed recovery sessions - Runs triage on each session - Updates memory bank via replay script - Generates delegation summary ## Key Features - Works offline without cursor-agent-manager MCP - Filters for valid GitHub org/repo patterns - Integrates with existing replay_agent_session.py - Documents usage in TOOLS_REFERENCE.md ## Usage ```bash # Single session .cursor/scripts/agent-triage-local <agent-id> full # All unprocessed sessions .cursor/scripts/triage-pipeline ``` * security: Address code review feedback Addresses [@amazon-q-developer](https://github.com/amazon-q-developer) security concerns: 1. PATH Injection - Now checks if directory exists before adding to PATH 2. Input Validation - Added validate_agent_id() to sanitize agent IDs 3. Strict Mode - Added 'set -euo pipefail' for better error handling 4. Safe Path Construction - Use 'cd && pwd' for SCRIPTS_DIR The validated agent ID (alphanumeric + hyphens only) is safe for use in file paths and jq queries. --------- Co-authored-by: Cursor Agent &lt;cursoragent@cursor.com&gt; ([68a54fd](https://github.com/jbcom/control-center/commit/68a54fdf010186111bdfe004e430656c0cc145fe))

* **ai-triage:** complete AI-powered PR triage package with MCP integration ([#270](https://github.com/jbcom/control-center/issues/270)) * docs(agents): add MANDATORY AI QA review protocol before merge BREAKING CHANGE: Agents must now engage AI reviewers before any merge. Changes: - Updated .cursor/rules/15-ai-qa-engagement.mdc with comprehensive mandatory protocol - Added AI QA review section to .ruler/AGENTS.md - Added review commands: /gemini review, /q review, [@copilot](https://github.com/copilot) review, [@cursor](https://github.com/cursor) review - Added merge checklist requiring AI review completion - Added feedback addressing requirements (fix or justify, never ignore) This ensures quality by requiring peer review from AI agents on all PRs. * fix(agents): address Amazon Q feedback on QA protocol Fixes based on AI review feedback: 1. Clarified scope - explicit 'Required' vs 'Optional' sections 2. Fixed example to use conventional commit with scope 3. Added specific enforcement criteria 4. Added AI-to-AI conflict resolution process 5. Made checklists consistent between both files 6. Added audit trail and revert policy to enforcement * fix(agents): address ALL inline feedback from Amazon Q and Gemini Addressed feedback items: From Amazon Q: - Clarified 'ALWAYS Request Review For' to be specific items not 'any code changes' - Added escalation path for cross-agent conflicts - Updated example to use project-specific scope (dic) - Specified all listed commands are valid QA agents - Added detection mechanism for enforcement - Clarified checklist item to require review 'completed' - Added team lead escalation for revert policy From Gemini: - Changed 'MUST fix' to 'MUST be resolved' (allows false positive handling) - Clarified 'Out of scope' not valid for critical/high items - Added Thread Resolution section defining when thread is resolved - Made checklists identical between both files - Added severity-based feedback section to AGENTS.md - Changed 'fixed' to 'resolved' in all checklists * Checkpoint before follow-up message Co-authored-by: jon &lt;jon@jonbogaty.com&gt; * fix(agents): address Copilot/Gemini feedback + add auto AI review settings Addressed feedback: - Copilot: Added GITHUB_JBCOM_TOKEN to example workflow - Copilot: Added --delete-branch flag to merge command - Copilot: Added scope explanations in comments - Gemini: Clarified 'dic' scope with full list of scopes - Gemini: Made optional scope description consistent between files New section: - Added 'Repository Settings for Automatic AI Review' with instructions for enabling Copilot code review, rulesets, and CODEOWNERS config * fix(agents): clarify which AI reviewers are comment-triggered vs automatic - /gemini review, /q review, [@coderabbitai](https://github.com/coderabbitai) review -&gt; Comment-triggered - Copilot -&gt; Automatic via repo settings OR manual assignment - Cursor Bugbot -&gt; Automatic on all PRs This explains why '[@copilot](https://github.com/copilot) review' comment didn't work - Copilot needs to be enabled in repo settings or manually added as reviewer. * fix(agents): address final Gemini feedback - Added specific false positive reporting process (create issue with ai-review-feedback label) - Added 'automated' to Dependabot exception for consistency - Formatted AI conflict resolution as bulleted list for readability * Checkpoint before follow-up message Co-authored-by: jon &lt;jon@jonbogaty.com&gt; * fix(agents): address 5 Gemini feedback items 1.

Command Injection Prevention: - Sanitize all user inputs (PR titles, issue titles/bodies, commit messages) - Use environment variables instead of direct interpolation - Use jq --arg for safe JSON query interpolation 2. Cross-Platform Compatibility: - Replace GNU-specific date -d with fallback to BSD date -v - Replace base64 -w0 with base64 | tr -d '\n' 3. Credential Protection: - Remove CURSOR_API_KEY from echo statements (CWE-532) - Use env vars for sensitive data 4. Error Handling: - Replace silent 2&gt;/dev/null || true with explicit error logging - Add meaningful warnings when operations fail 5. Code Quality: - Centralize ECOSYSTEM_REPOS as env variable - Fix heredoc indentation issues - Add TODO markers for incomplete features Files modified: - agent-pr-review.yml - agent-post-merge.yml - agent-issue-triage.yml - agent-project-management.yml - spawn-cursor-agent/action.yml --------- Co-authored-by: Cursor Agent &lt;cursoragent@cursor.com&gt; ([09b6515](https://github.com/jbcom/control-center/commit/09b6515a02bdd473d83cd75d8d02154dc69cb435))

* Add mandatory tooling discovery and improve replay script ([#188](https://github.com/jbcom/control-center/issues/188)) CRITICAL CHANGES: 1. All root agent docs now require agents to READ THEIR OWN TOOLING FIRST 2. Updated: .cursor/rules/00-loader.mdc, .ruler/AGENTS.md, memory-bank/agenticRules.md 3. Improved replay_agent_session.py with automatic artifact extraction Agents MUST read at session start: - docs/CURSOR-AGENT-MANAGEMENT.md - docs/AGENTIC-DIFF-RECOVERY.md - docs/AGENT-TO-AGENT-HANDOFF.md - .cursor/scripts/ Tools available: - cursor-agents (sub-agent management) - agent-triage-local (offline triage) - aider (forensic analysis) - replay_agent_session.py (memory bank updates) FAILURE TO DISCOVER OWN TOOLING = UNACCEPTABLE Co-authored-by: Cursor Agent &lt;cursoragent@cursor.com&gt; ([e8412f7](https://github.com/jbcom/control-center/commit/e8412f7eb865b823d856c5e9bdc28687d0f44db1))
* Add missing Claude command templates for repo sync ([#196](https://github.com/jbcom/control-center/issues/196)) - ecosystem-sync.md - fix-ci.md - review-pr.md - Updated label-issue.md - Updated claude.yml workflow template Co-authored-by: Cursor Agent &lt;cursoragent@cursor.com&gt; ([5801104](https://github.com/jbcom/control-center/commit/5801104dba488274f72c8425acd84ff0ab4faa2c))

* CI workflow broken by Unicode characters ([#152](https://github.com/jbcom/control-center/issues/152)) * Fix: Replace Unicode multiplication signs in CI workflow + add actionlint The CI workflow contained Unicode '×' (U+00D7) instead of ASCII 'x' in comments, causing GitHub Actions to fail with "workflow file issue" error. Changes: - Replace all '×' with 'x' in .github/workflows/ci.yml - Add actionlint to pre-commit hooks to catch workflow issues locally This was introduced in PR [#139](https://github.com/jbcom/control-center/issues/139) and has been breaking CI since. * Test: Add minimal workflow to debug CI issue * Test: Add matrix workflow * Test: Reusable workflow call * Test: Back to simple job * Test: Explicit repo reference for reusable workflow * Test: Reusable workflow in root workflows dir * Fix: Move reusable workflows to root directory GitHub Actions does not support reusable workflows in subdirectories. Moving all workflows from `.github/workflows/reusable/` to `.github/workflows/reusable-*.yml` fixes the "workflow file issue" error. Changes: - Move reusable/*.yml to reusable-*.yml - Update ci.yml to reference new paths - Remove test workflow files * Fix: Use single-line JSON for GITHUB_OUTPUT compatibility * Run pre-commit autoupdate to manage hook versions Let pre-commit's autoupdate determine the correct versions rather than manually specifying them. --------- Co-authored-by: Cursor Agent &lt;cursoragent@cursor.com&gt; ([b2fd6fc](https://github.com/jbcom/control-center/commit/b2fd6fcc6277253c40221332fab249f7f30a8f31))

* **ci:** Fix syntax error in monorepo commit parser ([#218](https://github.com/jbcom/control-center/issues/218)) The commit_body_components_separator function had malformed code: - Missing 'if match := self.issue_selector.match(text):' conditional - Orphaned 'has_number.search,' line that was a copy-paste artifact This was causing semantic-release to fail with: unexpected indent (monorepo_parser.py, line 256) Without this fix, no packages can be released because semantic-release cannot parse commit messages.

* **ci:** Pass GH_TOKEN to semantic-release and skip VCS release - Add GH_TOKEN env var to Bump version step - Add --no-vcs-release flag to skip GitHub release creation ([b9bfb14](https://github.com/jbcom/control-center/commit/b9bfb148acb1d2c585c61f41bf322850487d0c49))
* **ci:** remove automatic AI review from CI ([#224](https://github.com/jbcom/control-center/issues/224)) Remove automatic AI review - use manual triggers ([@cursor](https://github.com/cursor) review, /q review, etc.) when needed ([798094e](https://github.com/jbcom/control-center/commit/798094e2494eb0a114ee9b6292444cf04e70d906))
* **ci:** remove invalid --skip-existing flag from semantic-release ([#281](https://github.com/jbcom/control-center/issues/281)) The --skip-existing flag doesn't exist in python-semantic-release.

* Remove invalid YAML workflows ([#199](https://github.com/jbcom/control-center/issues/199)) Removed workflows with multiline string YAML parsing issues: - agent-issue-triage.yml - agent-post-merge.yml - agent-project-management.yml - agentic-cycle.yml These workflows had heredoc/multiline strings that caused YAML parsing failures (content at column 1 interpreted as YAML keys). Keeping working workflows: - CI (main workflow) - claude-*.yml (Claude Code automation) - sync-claude-tooling.yml (cross-repo sync) - publish-wiki.yml - reusable-*.yml Will recreate the removed workflows with proper YAML formatting in a follow-up PR.

* skip LFS during repo sync to avoid broken object errors ([#408](https://github.com/jbcom/control-center/issues/408)) Add GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 to both sync steps to prevent failures when syncing to repos with missing/broken LFS objects (like python-ai-game-dev).

* **sync:** move Dockerfile to always-sync for forced propagation ([#335](https://github.com/jbcom/control-center/issues/335)) Urgent: Force Dockerfile propagation to all repos per user request ([4c73aa8](https://github.com/jbcom/control-center/commit/4c73aa8e9da4cb0ca24b1c9401b9244fb373e66c))
* **sync:** update workflow matrices to include all 18 repositories ([#352](https://github.com/jbcom/control-center/issues/352)) The sync.yml config file was updated in PR [#348](https://github.com/jbcom/control-center/issues/348) with all repos, but the workflow matrices were not updated. This fixes the sync-secrets, sync-branch-protection, and sync-pages jobs to target all repositories: Python (8): - agentic-crew, ai_game_dev, directed-inputs-class, extended-data-types - lifecyclelogging, python-terraform-bridge, rivers-of-reckoning, vendor-connectors Node.js/TypeScript (6): - agentic-control, otter-river-rush, otterfall, pixels-pygame-palace - rivermarsh, strata Go (2): - port-api, vault-secret-sync Terraform (2): - terraform-github-markdown, terraform-repository-automation Also updates generate-tests.yml to include all Python repos.

* **terraform:** switch from HCP Terraform to local backend ([#360](https://github.com/jbcom/control-center/issues/360)) The TF_API_TOKEN secret was not configured, causing all Terraform init operations to fail with 'Required token could not be found'. Changed to local backend which will work without external dependencies. For repo config management this is fine since Terraform reconciles against actual GitHub repo state on each run.

* **terragrunt:** remove duplicate required_providers from modules ([#365](https://github.com/jbcom/control-center/issues/365)) The root terragrunt.hcl generates a provider.tf file with required_providers blocks. Having the same blocks in the module's main.tf causes Terraform to fail with: Error: Duplicate required providers configuration A module may have only one required providers configuration. Removed required_providers from: - terragrunt-stacks/modules/repository/main.tf - terragrunt-stacks/modules/tfe-workspaces/main.tf The provider configuration is now solely managed by Terragrunt's generate blocks in the root and individual unit configs.

* **terragrunt:** remove invalid feature branch patterns and modernize module ([#364](https://github.com/jbcom/control-center/issues/364)) * Checkpoint before follow-up message Co-authored-by: jon &lt;jon@jonbogaty.com&gt; * fix(terragrunt): remove invalid feature branch patterns and fix module BREAKING CHANGE: Removes unapproved feature branch patterns Changes: - Remove invalid branch patterns (feature/*, bugfix/*, etc.) that caused GitHub API 422 errors - Remove legacy import {} block from module (should be CLI operation) - Base ruleset configuration on Strata repository patterns: - Main branch: linear history, no force push, PR with thread resolution - Admin bypass enabled - Remove unsupported Copilot/code_quality ruleset rules (not in TF provider) - Rename common_branch_protection to common_settings - Clean up all 18 repo terragrunt.hcl files - Net reduction: 121 insertions, 272 deletions Fixes CI failure: Invalid target patterns validation error * fix(terragrunt): match Strata patterns exactly, reject AI hallucinations Module now matches Strata repository configuration EXACTLY: - non_fast_forward = true - required_linear_history = true - pull_request with 0 approvals, thread resolution - NO code owner review (Gemini hallucination - not in docs) - NO deletion rule (Gemini hallucination - Strata doesn't have it) - NO required_status_checks (Gemini hallucination - empty default in docs) Added per documented requirements: - DRY binary_file_regex local variable - Descriptions on all secret variables Reference: docs/TERRAFORM-REPOSITORY-MANAGEMENT.md confirms: - require_code_owner_reviews = false (default) - required_status_checks_contexts = [] (empty default) - feature_branch_patterns = [] (empty default) Strata API response confirms NO deletion rule, NO status checks. * fix(ci): simplify Claude Code workflow, remove broken claude_args The custom prompt and claude_args were causing the action to fail with is_error: true. The nested quotes in claude_args weren't being parsed correctly. Simplified to use default behavior - the action handles PR context automatically without needing custom configuration. * fix(ci): add github_token to bypass OIDC workflow validation The Claude Code action validates workflow file integrity against main branch via OIDC. When workflow file differs (like in this PR), validation fails with 'Workflow validation failed'. Solution: Provide github_token to bypass OIDC and use standard auth. --------- Co-authored-by: Cursor Agent &lt;cursoragent@cursor.com&gt; ([6e2a1d3](https://github.com/jbcom/control-center/commit/6e2a1d3bf85fe91ede4023748a410c8ab30fc3a3))

* Use uvx pycalver instead of uv run pycalver ([#159](https://github.com/jbcom/control-center/issues/159)) uvx runs tools directly without needing to sync the workspace first. This is the proper way to run external tools like pycalver.

* **vendor-connectors:** Add __future__ annotations for Python 3.9 compatibility ([#123](https://github.com/jbcom/control-center/issues/123)) The code uses X | Y union syntax which requires Python 3.10+.

* **agents:** add MANDATORY AI QA review protocol before merge ([#266](https://github.com/jbcom/control-center/issues/266)) * docs(agents): add MANDATORY AI QA review protocol before merge BREAKING CHANGE: Agents must now engage AI reviewers before any merge. Changes: - Updated .cursor/rules/15-ai-qa-engagement.mdc with comprehensive mandatory protocol - Added AI QA review section to .ruler/AGENTS.md - Added review commands: /gemini review, /q review, [@copilot](https://github.com/copilot) review, [@cursor](https://github.com/cursor) review - Added merge checklist requiring AI review completion - Added feedback addressing requirements (fix or justify, never ignore) This ensures quality by requiring peer review from AI agents on all PRs. * fix(agents): address Amazon Q feedback on QA protocol Fixes based on AI review feedback: 1. Clarified scope - explicit 'Required' vs 'Optional' sections 2. Fixed example to use conventional commit with scope 3. Added specific enforcement criteria 4. Added AI-to-AI conflict resolution process 5. Made checklists consistent between both files 6. Added audit trail and revert policy to enforcement * fix(agents): address ALL inline feedback from Amazon Q and Gemini Addressed feedback items: From Amazon Q: - Clarified 'ALWAYS Request Review For' to be specific items not 'any code changes' - Added escalation path for cross-agent conflicts - Updated example to use project-specific scope (dic) - Specified all listed commands are valid QA agents - Added detection mechanism for enforcement - Clarified checklist item to require review 'completed' - Added team lead escalation for revert policy From Gemini: - Changed 'MUST fix' to 'MUST be resolved' (allows false positive handling) - Clarified 'Out of scope' not valid for critical/high items - Added Thread Resolution section defining when thread is resolved - Made checklists identical between both files - Added severity-based feedback section to AGENTS.md - Changed 'fixed' to 'resolved' in all checklists * Checkpoint before follow-up message Co-authored-by: jon &lt;jon@jonbogaty.com&gt; * fix(agents): address Copilot/Gemini feedback + add auto AI review settings Addressed feedback: - Copilot: Added GITHUB_JBCOM_TOKEN to example workflow - Copilot: Added --delete-branch flag to merge command - Copilot: Added scope explanations in comments - Gemini: Clarified 'dic' scope with full list of scopes - Gemini: Made optional scope description consistent between files New section: - Added 'Repository Settings for Automatic AI Review' with instructions for enabling Copilot code review, rulesets, and CODEOWNERS config * fix(agents): clarify which AI reviewers are comment-triggered vs automatic - /gemini review, /q review, [@coderabbitai](https://github.com/coderabbitai) review -&gt; Comment-triggered - Copilot -&gt; Automatic via repo settings OR manual assignment - Cursor Bugbot -&gt; Automatic on all PRs This explains why '[@copilot](https://github.com/copilot) review' comment didn't work - Copilot needs to be enabled in repo settings or manually added as reviewer. * fix(agents): address final Gemini feedback - Added specific false positive reporting process (create issue with ai-review-feedback label) - Added 'automated' to Dependabot exception for consistency - Formatted AI conflict resolution as bulleted list for readability * Checkpoint before follow-up message Co-authored-by: jon &lt;jon@jonbogaty.com&gt; * fix(agents): address 5 Gemini feedback items 1.
