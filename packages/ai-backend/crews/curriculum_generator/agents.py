# agents.py
# This file will define the different agents that make up the curriculum generator crew.
# Based on the epic, this will likely include agents for:
# - Curriculum design
# - Lesson writing
# - Code generation for cartridges
# - Quality assurance and validation

# TODO: Implement the agent definitions here.
