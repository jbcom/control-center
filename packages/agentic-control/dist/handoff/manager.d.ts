/**
 * Station-to-Station Handoff Protocol
 *
 * Enables seamless agent continuity:
 * 1. Current agent completes scope of work
 * 2. Spawns successor agent (not sub-agent - its own master)
 * 3. Successor confirms health via fleet tooling
 * 4. Successor retrieves predecessor's conversation
 * 5. Successor merges predecessor's PR
 * 6. Successor opens own PR and continues work
