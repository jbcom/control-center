# Agent Instructions - Wiki Reference

> **📚 All documentation is in the wiki**: https://github.com/jbcom/jbcom-control-center/wiki

## Session Start

Before any work, read these wiki pages:

```bash
# Core guidelines (MUST READ)
wiki-cli read "Agentic-Rules/Core-Guidelines"

# Current context (what's being worked on)
wiki-cli read "Memory-Bank/Active-Context"

# Progress history (what's been done)
wiki-cli read "Memory-Bank/Progress"
```

## Key Wiki Pages

|------|---------|
| [Core-Guidelines](https://github.com/jbcom/jbcom-control-center/wiki/Agentic-Rules/Core-Guidelines) | Universal agent rules |
| [Python-Standards](https://github.com/jbcom/jbcom-control-center/wiki/Agentic-Rules/Python-Standards) | SemVer, types, style |
| [PR-Ownership](https://github.com/jbcom/jbcom-control-center/wiki/Agentic-Rules/PR-Ownership) | AI collaboration |

## Update Memory Bank

```bash
# Update active context
wiki-cli write "Memory-Bank/Active-Context" "# Active Context
## Current Focus

## Active Work

# Append to progress
wiki-cli append "Memory-Bank/Progress" "## Session: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%d)
### Completed

```

## Critical Rules

1. **SemVer via python-semantic-release** - Never manually edit versions
2. **Use GITHUB_JBCOM_TOKEN** - For all jbcom repo operations
3. **Read wiki first** - Before making decisions
4. **Update wiki** - After completing work
