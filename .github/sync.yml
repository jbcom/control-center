# SYNC BEHAVIOR:
# ==============
# - always-sync/: Overwrites on every sync (rules stay authoritative)
# - initial-only/: Only syncs if file doesn't exist (replace: false)
# - ruler/: Initial sync only - repos manage via Ruler CLI and sync-ruler.yml workflow
# - Language dirs: Always sync (language rules are authoritative)
#
# MIGRATION TO RULER:
# ===================
# The Cursor rules sync is being replaced by the Ruler framework.
# Ruler centralizes AI agent instructions in .ruler/ and distributes to all agents.
# Use the sync-ruler.yml workflow to generate/update .ruler/ configurations.
# See: https://github.com/intellectronica/ruler
