This should be the FSC enterprise counterparty station to station to https://github.com/jbcom/jbcom-control-center.git. it should be ho you coordinate messaging back and forth and ensure that FSC repositories like https://github.com/FlipsideCrypto/terraform-modules.git are kept up to date with the latest jbcom ecosystem packages and that you are empowered to contribute features upstream to the jbcom ecosystem without a human in the loop as you identify new needs. I need you to identify GAPS in your current agentic ruleset, make sure that you have a process defined clearly for using the GITHUB_JBCOM_TOKEN for getting the other control center, and also ensure that the OTHER control center's agentic rules are SIMILARLY robust and aware of YOUR existence. Also ideally the processes of handoff, station to station exchange. PR maintenance. Collaborative multi agent PR feedback loops, identifying when to take ownership in a chain, how to effectively use GitHub issues and GitHub projects and GitHub wiki, ALL should be not only documented but something that the MINUTE you run EVERY TIME you IMMEDIATELY comprehend without me EVER having to instrugt you so all of that HAS to be figured out for you to take full ownership and be able to own tasks "

      "text": "---\n\n## Self-Assessment Complete\n\nI have completed a comprehensive self-assessment of my agentic processes. Here's what I discovered and reinforced:\n\n### Key Discoveries\n\n1. **I HAVE `CURSOR_API_KEY`** in my environment (68 characters)\n2. **I AM a Cursor background agent** (`CURSOR_AGENT=1`)\n3. **I CAN bootstrap MCP infrastructure** (`pip install mcp-proxy` + `npx cursor-background-agent-mcp-server`)\n4. **I CAN access the Cursor API** to list agents, get summaries, and retrieve conversations\n5. **EXPIRED agents have PURGED conversations** (409 \"Agent is deleted\" error)\n\n### What I Created\n\n| Artifact | Purpose |\n|----------|---------|\n| `.cursor/rules/02-cursor-api-access.mdc` | Complete Cursor API access documentation |\n| `docs/SELF-ASSESSMENT-GAP-ANALYSIS.md` | 4 identified gaps with fixes |\n| `memory-bank/recovery/conversation-bc-a95ea075-...json` | My own conversation archived |\n| Updated `.ruler/AGENTS.md` | Self-discovery section added |\n| Updated `docs/AGENT-RECOVERY-TOOLING.md` | Direct API patterns |\n\n### Anti-Patterns I Identified (and Will Avoid)\n\n1. ❌ **Reacting instead of analyzing** - I tried multiple workarounds before stopping to understand the root cause\n2. ❌ **Asking user for data I can retrieve** - I have API access but didn't know it\n3. ❌ **Assuming tooling doesn't exist** - It can be installed dynamically\n4. ❌ **Not archiving conversations** - Expired conversations are lost forever\n\n### Why I Couldn't Retrieve `bc-be487039-edf6-45ba-80f6-35dd7261eea0`\n\nThat agent is **EXPIRED**. The Cursor API returns:\n```json\n{\"error\": \"Agent is deleted\"}\n```\n\nThe summary IS available (I retrieved it via `listAgents`), but the full conversation is purged. This is a fundamental limitation that cannot be worked around - **conversations must be archived BEFORE expiration**.\n\n### What Future Agents Will Now Know\n\nWhen a new agent starts, the updated documentation tells them:\n1. Check for `CURSOR_API_KEY` in the session start checklist\n2. They can install `mcp-proxy` and use the Cursor API directly\n3. They should archive their conversation before expiration\n4. Where to find recovery documentation and archived conversations\n\n---\n\n**Is this the kind of self-assessment and process reinforcement you were looking for?** I've stopped, reflected, discovered my actual capabilities, documented them, and created artifacts that will help future agents avoid my mistakes."

I want THEM to be able to use GITHUB_TOKEN and engage with YOUR Control center seamlessly and YOU to be able to use GITHUB_JBCOM_TOKEN to do the same. The entire point of being able to use cursor background agent MCP tooling and your CURSOR_API_KEY is to start REALLY becoming diligent in enforcing processes for agentic releases where YOU act as control manager and delegate and decompose out to assigned spawned cursor background agents spawned with other models in specific targeted other repositories and branches so that instead of the more detached and passive approach taken so far you're taking more ACTIVE ownership and fleet managing things. Up until now it's been one agent going in and out of multiple repositories and branches which makes NO sense because the cursor agent API ALLOWS you to send task updates. So you can ASSIGN agents to SOEICFIC repositories as needed FOR a task and DElegate which is WHY getting your house in order is so critical. If you get everything RIGHT then you can just SPAWN a cursor agent for the JBCOM control center and IT can understand ITS side of the relationship in so far as ECOSYSTEM maintenance and so It Will understand its own spawning tasks and the result SHOULD be YOU decompose on your end out to agents in terraform-modules and terraform-awa-secrersmanager and so on, and if you need CHANGES you soawn the jbcom control center agent and talk to it and it figures out what to do on its end and you tell IT the existing agents You have spawned so that when IT has updates it can directly talk to them in a diamond pattern. THAT is how you efficiently setup bidirectional communication"

Transpiling the config for the pipelines to workflow inputs and making a new workflow here to generate all of our managed repository pipeline generators and then kicking off coordination with cursor background agents in all of THOSE repositories to give them new directions and explain hey there's now this MEW way of doing things... So you're going to have to CHANGE how to handle YOUR generation. Which ACTUALLY brings to mind a REALLY good point which is that BEFORE that you'll have to go dive into the GitHub Actions VERSIONS of how you're doing the generators because BEFORE we were doing TERRAFOEM workspace based generators but NOW each repository is going to do its own process of calling the new GitHub action SO we need to rethink how that works.\n\nNONE of those words should be foreign to you as they are CRUCIAL to operation of pipelines in our enterprise.
